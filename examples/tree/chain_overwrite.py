# first define the chain of trees
chain = TreeChain(name="test", files=fnames)

# Now we want to copy the tree above into a new file while overwriting a branch
# First create a new file to save the new tree in:
f_copy = root_open("test_copy.root", "recreate")

# You may not know the entire model of the original tree but only the branches
# you intend to overwrite, so I am not specifying the model=Event below as an
# example of how to deal with this in general:
tree_copy = Tree("test_copy")

# If the original tree was not handed to you through rootpy don't forget to:
# >>> from rootpy import asrootpy
# >>> tree = asrootpy(tree)

# Here we specify the buffer for the new tree to use. We use the same buffer as
# the original tree. This creates all the same branches in the new tree but
# their addresses point to the same memory used by the original tree.
tree_copy.set_buffer(
        chain._buffer,
        create_branches=True)

# Now loop over the original tree and fill the new tree
for entry in chain:
    # Overwrite a branch value. This changes the value that will be written to
    # the new tree but leaves the value unchanged in the original tree on disk.
    entry.x = 3.141
    # "entry" is actually the buffer, which is shared between both trees.
    tree_copy.Fill()

# tree_copy is now a copy of tree where the "x" branch has been overwritten
# with new values
tree_copy.Write()
f_copy.Close()
