How to use logging with multiprocessing
---------------------------------------

The basic strategy is to set up a listener process which can have any logging
configuration you want - in this example, writing to rotated log files. Because
only the listener process writes to the log files, you don't have file
corruption caused by multiple processes trying to write to the file.

The listener process is initialised with a queue, and waits for logging events
(LogRecords) to appear in the queue. When they do, they are processed according
to whatever logging configuration is in effect for the listener process.

Other processes can delegate all logging to the listener process. They can have
a much simpler logging configuration: just one handler, a QueueHandler, needs
to be added to the root logger. Other loggers in the configuration can be set
up with levels and filters to achieve the logging verbosity you need.

A QueueHandler processes events by sending them to the multiprocessing queue
that it's initialised with.

    Because you'll want to define the logging configurations for listener and
    workers, the listener and worker process functions take a configurer
    parameter which is a callable for configuring logging for that process.
    These functions are also passed the queue, which they use for communication.

    In practice, you can configure the listener however you want, but note that
    in this simple example, the listener does not apply level or filter logic to
    received records. In practice, you would probably want to do ths logic in
    the worker processes, to avoid sending events which would be filtered out
    between processes.

    The size of the rotated files is made small so you can see the results
    easily.

    (LogRecords) on the queue and handle them, quit when you get a None for a
